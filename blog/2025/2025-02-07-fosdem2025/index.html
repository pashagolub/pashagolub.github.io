Every year, PostgreSQL developers, contributors, and users worldwide gather in Brussels for a week packed with talks, meetings, and discussions. Our community has a strong tradition at FOSDEM, with a dedicated developer room, a booth, and numerous side events</p> <p>One of the most recognizable FOSDEM traditions is <strong>FOSDEM Weather</strong> â€” a perfect mix of rain, cold, and clouds that always greets us in Brussels. Over the years, we even started selling PostgreSQL-branded umbrellas at our booth, and you could track the weather by watching the sales spike! But this year, for the first time in a while, the weather was <strong>sunny and perfect</strong> â€” so we joked that the weather was trying to lower our sales. ðŸ˜„</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/postgres-booth-fosdem-2025-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/postgres-booth-fosdem-2025-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/postgres-booth-fosdem-2025-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/postgres-booth-fosdem-2025" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="a-busy-week-for-postgresql">A Busy Week for PostgreSQL</h2> <p>FOSDEM week is always busy for the PostgreSQL community, with multiple events happening alongside the main conference:</p> <h3 id="p2d2-conference"><strong>P2D2 Conference</strong></h3> <p>Held earlier in the week, the <strong>Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day (P2D2)</strong> is a major PostgreSQL event that gathers experts for in-depth discussions. For a detailed experience of the event, check out <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/my-first-experience-at-p2d2/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ants Aasmaâ€™s blog post</a>.</p> <h3 id="postgresql-developer-meeting"><strong>PostgreSQL Developer Meeting</strong></h3> <p>On <strong>Thursday, January 30th</strong>, PostgreSQL core developers and contributors held a private developer meeting to discuss ongoing projects, significant challenges, and future PostgreSQL development. More details can be found on the <a href="https://2025.fosdempgday.org/devmeeting/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">official event page</a>.</p> <h3 id="fosdem-pgday"><strong>FOSDEM PGDay</strong></h3> <p>On <strong>Friday, January 31st</strong>, we had <strong>FOSDEM PGDay</strong>, a full-day PostgreSQL conference. The schedule featured talks on a wide range of PostgreSQL topics, from performance tuning to backups and new features. The complete schedule is available <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/fosdem2025/schedule/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <h3 id="postgresql-devroom-at-fosdem"><strong>PostgreSQL Devroom at FOSDEM</strong></h3> <p>The <strong>PostgreSQL Devroom</strong> took place on <strong>Sunday, February 2nd</strong>, featuring sessions on database performance, replication, analytics, AI/ML, and more. This year, we had great discussions about PostgreSQL internals, best practices, and real-world use cases. You can find the complete session list <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/postgresql/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. The talk records will be available shortly.</p> <h2 id="community--networking">Community &amp; Networking</h2> <p>FOSDEM is not just about talksâ€”itâ€™s about meeting people, sharing ideas, and strengthening the community. As usual, there were plenty of social events and informal gatherings.</p> <p>One of the highlights for me was attending the <strong>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) event on Saturday evening</strong>, where I had the chance to meet new and long-time friends. GSoC continues to be an essential program for PostgreSQL, and it was great to see the enthusiasm for mentoring and open-source contributions. Right now, PostgreSQL org is gathering <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2025" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">project ideas and mentors</a>. If you want to be a mentor, you still have time until February 10th!</p> <h2 id="contributions--recognition">Contributions &amp; Recognition</h2> <p>This yearâ€™s central topic of discussion was <strong>contributions</strong>: what counts as a contribution, how we measure it, and how we recognize non-code contributions. Our community relies on the work of many people beyond just developers: event organizers, documentation writers, speakers, translators, and advocates all play a massive role in making PostgreSQL what it is today.</p> <p>To help highlight and recognize these contributions, we put a lot of effort into building our new website: <strong><a href="https://postgres-contrib.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">postgres-contrib.org</a></strong>. This platform helps track contributions and provides a way to nominate and recognize those who support the community.</p> <h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2> <p>The <strong>spirit of the PostgreSQL community</strong> is what makes FOSDEM so special every year. I want to extend my <strong>huge thanks</strong> to all the volunteers, organizers, and contributors who made this event possible.</p> <p>Special thanks to:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href="https://2025.fosdempgday.org/callforpapers/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Call for Papers team</a> (which I was part of) for reviewing and selecting the talks.</li> <li>All <strong>speakers</strong> who shared their knowledge.</li> <li>The <strong>attendees</strong> who made the devroom lively and interactive.</li> </ul> <p>A special shoutout to <strong>volunteers</strong>, both scheduled and spontaneous. While we had a volunteer schedule for the booth, many community members stepped up to help when needed. For example, <strong>Bruce Momjian</strong> spent hours assisting visitors at the booth, helping find PostgreSQL T-shirts and hoodies in the correct sizes. And <strong>Ants Aasma</strong> helped a team of bouncers (well, pg bouncers, if you know what I mean ;) ). Many others did the same, proving once again that our community is built on <strong>collaboration and generosity</strong>.</p> <p>We had a fantastic time at FOSDEM 2025, and I canâ€™t wait to do it all again next year!</p> <p>Until then, keep contributing and keep the PostgreSQL spirit alive! ðŸš€</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/pavlo-golub-fosdem-2025-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/pavlo-golub-fosdem-2025-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/pavlo-golub-fosdem-2025-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/pavlo-golub-fosdem-2025.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </body></html>
