Just imagine how much time and effort you need to release a one-hour podcast! Kudos! I also decided to put in some effort, so I wore my sneakers, put on earphones, and walked for one hour at a brisk pace! See! Not only do Postgres events make you smarter, but also your heart stronger! </p> <p>Many topics are covered in this episode: virtual vs. in-person events, session recordings, volunteering vs. paid professionals, Call for Papers, speakers, organizers, and many more!</p> <h2>A Newbies Perspective by Grant Fritchey</h2> <p>Knowing Grant came from the MSSQL world with its substantial multi-thousand gatherings, I was interested in <a href="https://www.scarydba.com/2023/12/01/postgresql-events-a-newbies-perspective-pgsqlphriday-014/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his perception</a>.</p> <p>We've met with Grant at his first Postgres conference in Malta this year. Like most of the series' first events, the <a href="https://2023.pgdaymed.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first PGDay/MED</a> was relatively small and cozy. </p> <p>I'm delighted that Grant thinks the PostgreSQL community is welcoming, strong, vibrant, and kind.<br> I disagree with his statement that Postgres events often seem centrally managed, contrasting with the more bottom-up approach in the SQL Server community. We should discuss this further during the upcoming 13th annual <a href="https://2023.pgconf.eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PostgreSQL Conference Europe</a> in Prague, Czechia. ðŸ™‚ </p> <p>This year we have a bigger venue so you still have a chance to <a href="https://2023.pgconf.eu/registration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attend</a> this important event.</p> <h2>Seattle Postgres User Group and PASS Summit by Jeremy Schneider</h2> <p><a href="https://ardentperf.com/2023/12/01/seattle-postgres-user-group-and-pass-summit-pgsql-phriday-014/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jeremy's post</a> highlights the vibrant Seattle Postgres User Group's successful year, with growing attendance and diverse topics discussed.
