Well, you know me! I always want to inject a bit of humor and fun. Welcome to the inaugural <strong>"Golden Trunk 2023"</strong> award – my impulsive celebration of PostgreSQL community brilliance, where a golden elephant trunk steals the spotlight. Inspired by the grandeur of events like the Oscars and Globes, the "Golden Trunk" award was born – a celebration of the best articles about PostgreSQL!</p> <h2>Judged by Yours Truly: Me</h2> <p>I'm keeping things refreshingly simple in a world dominated by complex algorithms and intricate scoring systems. What are the criteria for determining the most viewed articles? Look no further than my discerning eye! That's right – I, Pavlo Golub, will personally judge articles!</p> <h2>Exclusively Cybertec This Year!</h2> <p>In the grand tradition of starting small and dreaming big, the inaugural edition of the "Golden Trunk" award will be an exclusive affair for our talented Cybertec authors – my colleagues. I'm turning the spotlight onto the incredible minds, recognizing the outstanding contributions of my colleagues who bring PostgreSQL expertise to life in their articles.</p> <h2>Cheers to Hans-Jürgen Schönig: The First Golden Trunk Winner!</h2> <div class="center-wrapper"> <div class="author_meta"> <span class="avatar-img lazyloaded" data-bg="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hans-Jürgen-Schönig.jpg" style="background-image: url('/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hans-Jürgen-Schönig.jpg');"></span> <span class="author-bio">&lt;/p&gt; <p class="author-bio__description"> </p> <p>I'm excited to announce that the first-ever "Golden Trunk" award goes to <a href="/en/author/cybertec_schoenig/">Hans-Jürgen Schönig</a> for his fantastic blog post titled <a href="/en/error-permission-denied-schema-public/">"PostgreSQL ERROR: permission denied for schema public."</a> In this helpful piece, Hans-Jürgen talks about a significant change in how PostgreSQL 15 handles permissions for the public schema.
