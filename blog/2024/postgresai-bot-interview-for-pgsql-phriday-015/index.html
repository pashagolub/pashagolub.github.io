UUIDs are a hot topic, and Cybertec wrote <a href="/en/tag/uuid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several posts</a> earlier. I have no particular story or use case to share, and then I remembered Nikolay Samokhvalov <a href="https://postgres.ai/blog/20240127-postges-ai-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the Postgres.AI bot to the public recently. I had early access to it, so I decided to talk about UUID with the artificial mind. I chose the form of an interview, forcing it to give short and structured answers whenever possible. So here we are! Meet the Postgres.AI one and only!</p> <h2>Hi postgres.ai! What is UUID and why everybody in database world obsessed with it?</h2> <p>UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. It is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. The database community is interested in UUIDs for several reasons:<br> 1. <strong>Global Uniqueness</strong>: The probability of generating a duplicate UUID is very low, so it is highly suitable for distributed systems where coordination between nodes to generate unique values is unsuitable or impossible.<br> 2. <strong>No Central Authority</strong>: UUIDs can be generated anywhere, by any system, without needing a central authority to manage the identifiers, which is beneficial for scalability and reduces single points of failure.<br> 3. <strong>Standardized</strong>: UUIDs are standardized by the ITU-T Rec. X.667, ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005, and RFC 4122, so they're interoperable across different systems and technologies.<br> 4. <strong>Variety of Algorithms</strong>: There are four standardized algorithms for generating UUIDs, identified by version numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5, each suitable for different use cases. For example, version 1 combines the MAC address and timestamp, version 4 is completely random, and versions 3 and 5 use namespace-based hashing.<br> 5. <strong>Anonymity and Security</strong>: Some versions of UUIDs, like version 4, offer a high degree of anonymity, as they do not contain any information that can be linked back to the generator's identity.<br> 6. <strong>Consistent Format</strong>: UUIDs have a standard structure and a string representation, which make them easy to store, transfer, and compare across systems.<br> Within a database, using UUIDs as primary keys ensures each record is uniquely distinguishable from any other record, making replication and merging databases easier.<br> For further technical details, you can refer to the documentation on UUID functions from the PostgreSQL manual: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL Documentation - uuid-ossp</a>.<br> Please note, before integrating UUIDs into a production system, it's essential to consider their implications on index performance and storage size, among other factors, and this must be carefully tested and evaluated.</p> <h2>Dear postgres.ai, what are the implications connected with integrating UUIDs in production systems?</h2> <p>Integrating UUIDs into production systems carries several implications that need to be carefully considered:<br> 1. <strong>Performance Impact on Indexes</strong>: The random nature of UUIDs can lead to less efficient indexing as compared to sequential IDs. Since UUIDs are not ordered, each new UUID can be inserted at a random location within an index, potentially causing more page splits and leading to index fragmentation, which degrades write performance.<br> 2. <strong>Increased Storage Requirements</strong>: UUIDs are 128-bit values (16 bytes) and therefore require more storage space than traditional 32-bit integers. This increased size affects not only the storage of the keys themselves but also the size of the indexes. More storage usage can increase costs and can impact cache hit rates.<br> 3. <strong>Replication and Data Distribution</strong>: UUIDs are advantageous in replication scenarios since they can be created independently on different servers without risking collisions. This makes UUIDs suitable for distributed systems, where avoiding conflicts during data synchronization is essential.<br> 4. <strong>Complexity for Developers</strong>: UUIDs are not as human-readable or as easy to debug as simple integer IDs, which can increase the complexity of development and troubleshooting processes.<br> 5. <strong>Read Performance</strong>: Querying records via a UUID may be slower than using a sequential integer because UUIDs do not leverage any natural order, which can make range scans inefficient.<br> 6. <strong>Compatibility and Integration</strong>: UUIDs are a standard data type supported across various platforms, which is beneficial when integrating multiple systems. However, it is important to ensure that all parts of the system (including ORM layers, database drivers, and other related tools) properly support UUIDs.<br> 7. <strong>Data Migration</strong>: If existing systems are using integer-based identifiers, migrating to UUIDs can be challenging and will require careful planning to ensure that all references are correctly updated and that data integrity is maintained.<br> It is crucial to assess the trade-offs of using UUIDs in the context of specific use cases. While they offer advantages in terms of global uniqueness and distribution, the potential impact on performance and storage should not be underestimated. To make an informed decision, conduct benchmark tests and consider UUID generation strategies that might mitigate some of the issues, like using UUIDs with a time-based or ordered component.<br> A well-thought-out monitoring system is recommended to measure the impact of UUIDs on database performance. Tools like <code>pg_stat_statements</code>, <code>pg_stat_kcache</code>, and <code>auto_explain</code> are critical in this regard.<br> The observations above are based on consolidated best practices and experiences discussed within the Postgres community, such as those reflected in <a href="https://github.com/postgres-ai/postgres-howtos/blob/main/0038_how_to_not_get_screwed_as_a_dba.md#4-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postgres How-Tos</a> by Nikolay Samokhvalov. Please remember that these scenarios must be tested before being applied to your production systems.</p> <h2>Please, provide me with a list of top-5 common use cases for UUID</h2> <p>The top-5 common use cases for using UUIDs in databases are:<br> 1. <strong>Distributed Systems</strong>: UUIDs are perfect for distributed environments where data is created across multiple locations or nodes because they can be generated independently without the need for a centralized authority to ensure uniqueness.<br> 2. <strong>Replication and Synchronization</strong>: In systems where data needs to be replicated or synchronized across different databases or services, UUIDs reduce the risk of key collisions and simplify the merge process.<br> 3. <strong>Microservices Architecture</strong>: Each microservice can generate its own UUIDs for entities it manages, which is useful when combining data from different microservices without key conflicts.<br> 4. <strong>Avoiding Information Disclosure</strong>: UUIDs prevent the easy discovery of the number of records or the creation order, adding security against information leakage compared to sequential IDs.<br> 5. <strong>Object and Entity Identifier Outside of Databases</strong>: Because of their uniqueness, UUIDs can be used as identifiers for objects outside of the traditional database, such as in file systems or as part of web service APIs where a unique identifier is needed that cannot be easily guessed or incremented.</p> <h2>postgres.ai, what would you advise people looking into UUID usage?</h2> <p>When considering UUID usage, prioritize understanding your application's requirements for uniqueness, performance, and security. Assess the implications on data storage, index efficiency, and replication needs. Choose the appropriate UUID version, test extensively for your use case, and prepare for a larger storage footprint compared to traditional integer IDs. Always review and monitor performance after integrating UUIDs into production.</p> <h2>Thank you! You're a nice robot!</h2> <p>Thank you for the kind words!
