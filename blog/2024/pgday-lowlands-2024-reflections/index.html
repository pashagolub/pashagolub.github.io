Naturally, I was curious about passing through the famous tunnel under La Manche (some folks call it the English Channel, but I am still unsure why ????). Spoiler alert: there's nothing cool to see, just darkness. ðŸ™‚</p> <p>If you want to read about PGDay UK 2024, I recommend <a href="https://dataegret.com/2024/09/back-from-pgday-uk-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the blog post</a> of my friend Stefan Fercot. Thank God he did a great job, so I can focus only on one event instead of two! ????</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-special-connection-with-amsterdam">A Special Connection with Amsterdam</h2> <p>PGDay Lowlands 2024 marks the first year of this event, but Amsterdam holds a special place in my professional journey. My first ever PostgreSQL community conference was in this beautiful city, way back in 2011, during <a href="https://2011.pgconf.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pgconf.eu</a>. So, Amsterdam isn't just another city for me; it's a key part of my community and professional life. I always love coming back here.</p> <p>The conference schedule was pretty packed, so I only had a little time to visit my favorite places in Amsterdam this time. But the experience of the conference itself made up for that.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-my-talk-customizing-the-wordle-game-experience-with-postgresql">My Talk: "Customizing the Wordle Game Experience with PostgreSQL"</h2> <p>My presentation was titled "Customizing the Wordle Game Experience with PostgreSQL." Despite the fun name, the talk covered some serious and interesting topics, like full-text search dictionaries and customizing psql. The best part? We ended the talk by playing Wordle with the audience, where they had to guess PostgreSQL 5-letter keywords. I'm happy to report that <a href="https://postgresql.life/post/gianni_ciolli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gianni Ciolli</a> is officially the best keyword professional among us! ????</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" width="2048" height="1363" src="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wordle-PGDay-Amsterdam.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-127051" srcset="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wordle-PGDay-Amsterdam.jpg 2048w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wordle-PGDay-Amsterdam-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wordle-PGDay-Amsterdam-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wordle-PGDay-Amsterdam-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wordle-PGDay-Amsterdam-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Wordle-PGDay-Amsterdam-18x12.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure> </div> <p></p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-second-chance">A Second Chance</h2> <p>I initially presented this talk once at PgConf in New York, but unfortunately, my slot was in parallel with <a href="https://postgresql.life/post/bruce_momjian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce Momjian's</a> session. Naturally, many attendees chose to go to his talk (honestly, I would have done the same!). That left me with little feedback and some doubts about the talk's appeal. So, I'm incredibly thankful to the PGDay Lowlands Call for Papers <a href="https://2024.pgday.nl/organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committee</a> for giving me a second chance! It was such a relief to see that the audience loved it and to have great questions and discussions afterward.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-friendly-and-perfect-atmosphere">A Friendly and Perfect Atmosphere</h2> <p>The atmosphere at PGDay Lowlands was perfectâ€”so friendly! One of the aspects I loved the most was having a meetup the day before the main event. It was the perfect opportunity to get to know the venue, meet some other speakers, and get into the conference mood. It was a brilliant idea, and I hope it becomes a tradition.</p> <p>I met many old friends and, of course, many new faces. It's always refreshing to reconnect with familiar people while getting to know new community members.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memorable-talks">Memorable Talks</h2> <p>All the talks were great, including the lightning talks. Still, one session stood out for its humor and creativity: <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdaynl2024/schedule/session/5967-postgresql-high-availability-poker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"PostgreSQL High Availability Poker."</a> The speakers took on roles like actors in a theater, and it was honestly one of the best comedies I've ever seen at a conference! It brought a unique and entertaining twist to the event.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" width="2048" height="1362" src="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Poker-PGDay-Amsterdam.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-127053" srcset="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Poker-PGDay-Amsterdam.jpg 2048w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Poker-PGDay-Amsterdam-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Poker-PGDay-Amsterdam-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Poker-PGDay-Amsterdam-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Poker-PGDay-Amsterdam-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Poker-PGDay-Amsterdam-18x12.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure> </div> <p></p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-venue-was-amazing">The Venue Was Amazing</h2> <p>The conference was held at an amazing venue! I absolutely loved the stage with a couch on itâ€”it felt so relaxed yet professional. The side monitors displaying Mastodon feeds and additional conference information were also great. I was especially impressed with the AV team. They were incredibly attentive, ensuring every speaker was fully prepared with mics before stepping on stage.</p> <p>PGDay Lowlands 2024 is easily one of the best PostgreSQL conferences I've ever attended. Next year, I hope they'll include a little local flavor â€” perhaps some Dutch cuisine like herring on the tables? ????</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-growing-postgresql-community">The Growing PostgreSQL Community</h2> <p>The PostgreSQL community is growing steadily, and it's heartwarming to see. More meetups, more eventsâ€”it's a true sign of progress. It's such a pleasure to witness this growth and be part of it.</p> <p>Local events like PGDay Lowlands are significant for the global growth of PostgreSQL. These smaller regional gatherings lay the groundwork for more extensive global initiatives. They help foster stronger connections within local communities.</p> <p>I'm already looking forward to the next PGDay Lowlands! The organizers are working on securing another excellent venue for next year, and I'm sure it will be another fantastic event.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exhausted-but-satisfied">Exhausted But Satisfied</h2> <p>After a week of traveling and attending two major conferences, I was definitely exhausted. Traveling is more challenging than it used to be when I was younger! But at the same time, I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. We accomplished so much, and it was all worth it.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" width="2048" height="1363" src="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cybertec-PGDay-Amsterdam.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-127055" srcset="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cybertec-PGDay-Amsterdam.jpg 2048w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cybertec-PGDay-Amsterdam-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cybertec-PGDay-Amsterdam-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cybertec-PGDay-Amsterdam-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cybertec-PGDay-Amsterdam-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cybertec-PGDay-Amsterdam-18x12.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure> </div> <p></p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-exciting-events-on-the-horizon">More Exciting Events on the Horizon</h2> <p>For me, there are still three crucial PostgreSQL events left this year:</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li> <a href="https://2024.pgconf.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL Europe Conference</a> in Athens</li> <li> <a href="https://passdatacommunitysummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PASS Data Community Summit</a> in Seattle</li> <li> <a href="https://2024.pgdaymed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PGDay/MED</a> in Napoli</li> </ul> <p>I'm excited to see what's in store at each of these incredible events!
