Please review this announcement blog <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/11/google-summer-of-code-2024-celebrating-20th-year.html">post</a>.</p> <p>And please make yourself familiar with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">GSoC 2024 timeline</a>!</p> <p>Now is the time to work on getting together a set of projects we‚Äôd like to have GSoC students work on over the summer. Like last year, we must have a good set of projects for students to choose from before the deadline for mentoring organizations.</p> <p>The deadline for Mentoring organizations to apply is <strong>February 6</strong>. The list of accepted organizations will be published on <strong>February 21</strong>.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, we‚Äôll need to have an Ideas page again, so I‚Äôve gone ahead and <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2024">created one</a> (copying last year‚Äôs).</p> <p>Google discusses what makes a good ‚ÄúIdeas‚Äù list <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list.html">here</a>.</p> <p>All the entries are marked with ‚Äò2023‚Äô to indicate they were pulled from last year. If the project from last year is still relevant, please update it to ‚Äò2024‚Äô. Make sure to revise all the information (in particular, list yourself as a mentor and remove the other mentors, as appropriate). Please also update the project‚Äôs scope to be reasonable for the time students are asked.</p> <p>Having at least two mentors per project is an excellent idea to decrease the load. Please consider listing yourself as a co-mentor for projects with only one mentor listed. The program‚Äôs goals are not limited solely to code writing. One of the goals is to inspire new developers to begin participating in open-source communities and to help open-source projects identify and bring in new developers.</p> <p>New entries are welcome and encouraged; note them as ‚Äò2024‚Äô when you add them.</p> <p><a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2023">Projects from last</a> year that were worked on but had significant follow-on work to be completed are also welcome - update the description appropriately and mark it as being for ‚Äò2024‚Äô.</p> <p>When we get closer to submitting our application, I‚Äôll clean out the ‚Äò2023‚Äô entries that have yet to receive any updates. Also, if any projects are no longer appropriate (maybe they were completed, for example, and no longer need work), please feel free to remove them. We may have missed some updates where a GSoC project was achieved independently of GSoC.</p> <p>As a reminder, each idea on the page should be in the format that the other entries are in and should include:</p> <ol> <li>Project Description</li> <li>Skills needed</li> <li>Difficulty Level</li> <li>Project Size</li> <li>Potential Mentors</li> <li>Expected Outcomes</li> <li>References</li> </ol> <p>As with last year, please consider PostgreSQL to be an <strong>‚ÄúUmbrella‚Äù</strong> project, and anything that would be regarded as a <strong>‚ÄúPostgreSQL Family‚Äù</strong> per the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/news-and-events/">News/Announce policy</a> is likely to be acceptable as a PostgreSQL GSoC project.</p> <p>In other words, if you‚Äôre a contributor or developer on WAL-G, barman, pgBackRest, pgwatch, pgagroal, pgexporter, pgmoneta, pgpool, pgbouncer, the PostgreSQL website (pgweb), the PgEU/PgUS website code (pgeu-system), pgAdmin4, DBeaver, HeidiSQL, pldebugger, pspg, the PG RPMs (pgrpms), the JDBC driver, the ODBC driver, or any of the many other PG Family projects, please feel free to add a project for consideration!</p> <p>Let‚Äôs have another great year of GSoC with PostgreSQL!<br/> PGForce be with you!</p> <p>Best regards,<br/> Pavlo Golub,<br/> on behalf of PostgreSQL GSoC Admins üíôüíõ</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="gsoc"/><category term="community"/><category term="postgresql"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google Summer of Code is back for 2024!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stop micro-posting to the Planet!</title><link href="https://pashagolub.github.io/blog/2023/stop-microposting-on-planet/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stop micro-posting to the Planet!"/><published>2023-10-25T13:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-25T13:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pashagolub.github.io/blog/2023/stop-microposting-on-planet</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pashagolub.github.io/blog/2023/stop-microposting-on-planet/"><![CDATA[<p>I want to share my concerns about <a href="https://planet.postgresql.org/">Planet PostgreSQL</a> content.

This release represents a significant leap forward in enhancing your PostgreSQL database mocking experience in Go.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the exciting changes and additions in this release:</p> <h2 id="high-priority-new-features">High-Priority New Features</h2> <h3 id="rewrite-with-findexpectationfunc">Rewrite with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findExpectationFunc()</code></h3> <p>I‚Äôve completely overhauled the internals of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgxmock</code> by rewriting all methods using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findExpectationFunc()</code>. This improvement allows us to add even more custom expectations without writing a duplicate code. The only thing we will need is a custom callback function to compare a new kind of expectation.</p> <h3 id="enhanced-expectations">Enhanced Expectations</h3> <p>I‚Äôve expanded the capabilities of <strong>all</strong> expectations with new methods like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WillDelayFor()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WillReturnError()</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WillPanic()</code>. Now you have even more control over how your mock database behaves in various scenarios.</p> <h3 id="introducing-times-and-maybe">Introducing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Times()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maybe()</code></h3> <p>I‚Äôm introducing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Times()</code> method, allowing you to specify how many times an expectation should be met. This feature enhances the flexibility of your mock database interactions. Meanwhile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maybe()</code> method allows the expectation to be optional. Not calling an optional method will not cause an error while asserting expectations.</p> <h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2> <h3 id="improved-test-coverage-">Improved Test Coverage <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/pashagolub/pgxmock?branch=master"><img src="https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pashagolub/pgxmock/badge.svg?branch=master" alt="Coverage Status"/></a></h3> <p>I‚Äôve extended test coverage, ensuring that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgxmock</code> remains a reliable choice for your testing needs. To make the testing even more comprehensive, I‚Äôve added several new test cases, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TestRowsConn()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TestPanic()</code>. These scenarios cover a wider range of potential use cases. They will help us to eliminate possible bugs in the future.</p> <h3 id="keeping-up-with-the-times">Keeping Up with the Times</h3> <p>I‚Äôm staying up-to-date with the latest developments. In this release, I‚Äôve bumped up the Go version to v1.21, ensuring compatibility and leveraging the newest features of the language.</p> <h3 id="introducing-callmodifier-interface">Introducing CallModifier Interface</h3> <p>I‚Äôve introduced the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CallModifier</code> interface to expectations, providing greater control and customization when working with mock database calls. All expectations currently support common behavior modifiers, like delay, error, and panic. We can extend the list later with ease.</p> <h2 id="ready-to-upgrade">Ready to Upgrade?</h2> <p>I encourage all users to upgrade to <strong>pgxmock v3</strong> to take advantage of these exciting enhancements and improvements. Whether you‚Äôre a long-time user or just getting started with pgxmock, these changes will elevate your database mocking experience to new heights.</p> <p>To get started with pgxmock v3, simply update your import statement:</p> <div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="s">"github.com/pashagolub/pgxmock/v3"</span>
