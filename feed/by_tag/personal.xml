Some authors‚Äô posts use spam and black SEO techniques, whether consciously or not.</p>

<p>What are the essential properties of such posts? These ‚Äúposts‚Äù are short, contain external links, and without any meaningful supplement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Planet PostgreSQL is not a microblog aggregator.</strong> I‚Äôm sure there is no place for one-sentence postings in the feed. Twitter, Bluesky, and Mastodon are all great places to go. No one will allow me to add my Mastodon RSS feed to the Planet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Planet PostgreSQL is not a place for gateway pages</strong> - also known as doorway pages. The only purpose of such posts is to rank for particular search queries without offering helpful information. Instead, these micro-posts will redirect the reader to a different page.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Planet PostgreSQL is not a place for a black SEO</strong>. Planet PostgreSQL is a subdomain of a high-ranked <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">postgresql.org</a>. This fact makes the Planet page a perfect place to have as many links to your blog/company site as possible. Posting a lot of meaningless micro-posts will:
    <ul>
      <li>Put and keep the author‚Äôs name in the ‚ÄúTop posters‚Äù section with a link;</li>
      <li>Put and keep the author‚Äôs company in the ‚ÄúTop Teams‚Äù section with a link;</li>
      <li>Put and keep links to micro-posts on the main postgresql.org page. 
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Planet PostgreSQL is a place for fair play.</strong> As a blog writer, I want to be in the same conditions as everyone else, regardless of the name, status, or previous achievements.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Planet PostgreSQL is a place for diversity and inclusion.</strong> First, I see it as an entry into the world of PostgreSQL ‚Äî the area where one follows the heartbeat of the community. Good-written and interesting stories serve that purpose. Micro-posts with a link in it don‚Äôt. Second, I see it as a workshop where all authors from competitive companies work together to set a high bar for quality content. Micro-posts are not good and cannot be called content, frankly speaking.</li>

This update enables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgx.QueryRewriter</code> interface support for mocking named parameters in your unit tests.</p>

<h2 id="named-parameters-in-postgres">Named parameters? In Postgres?</h2>

<p>The actual PostgreSQL <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code> style placeholders are not that bad when only a few exist. But it rapidly gets challenging to manage when there are many of them, especially when specific arguments are used multiple times.</p>

<p>If you want to know how to use named parameters in your application with <strong>pgx</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, check the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5#NamedArgs">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use named parameters in your code:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ctx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"select * from widgets where foo = @foo and bar = @bar"</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">pgx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NamedArgs</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"bar"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which is effectively the same as</p>
<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ctx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"select * from widgets where foo = $1 and bar = $2"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="introducing-withrewrittensql-to-pgxmock-expectations">Introducing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WithRewrittenSQL</code> to pgxmock expectations</h3>

<p>The machinery of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgx.QueryRewriter</code> interface is supposed to rewrite the initial query and apply parameter values. Since in a real-life application, we may use custom implementations, not only provided by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgx.NamedArgs</code>, we want to be able to check the final query. Exactly for this matter expectations <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pashagolub/pgxmock/v3#ExpectedExec">ExpectedExec</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pashagolub/pgxmock/v3#ExpectedQuery">ExpectedQuery</a> provide <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WithRewrittenSQL</code> method.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WithArgs</code> method now supports the list of plain values and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgx.QueryRewriter</code> interface as the first argument.</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-upgrade">Ready to Upgrade?</h2>

This release represents a significant leap forward in enhancing your PostgreSQL database mocking experience in Go.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the exciting changes and additions in this release:</p>

<h2 id="high-priority-new-features">High-Priority New Features</h2>

<h3 id="rewrite-with-findexpectationfunc">Rewrite with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findExpectationFunc()</code></h3>
<p>I‚Äôve completely overhauled the internals of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgxmock</code> by rewriting all methods using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">findExpectationFunc()</code>. This improvement allows us to add even more custom expectations without writing a duplicate code. The only thing we will need is a custom callback function to compare a new kind of expectation.</p>

<h3 id="enhanced-expectations">Enhanced Expectations</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve expanded the capabilities of <strong>all</strong> expectations with new methods like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WillDelayFor()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WillReturnError()</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WillPanic()</code>. Now you have even more control over how your mock database behaves in various scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="introducing-times-and-maybe">Introducing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Times()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maybe()</code></h3>
<p>I‚Äôm introducing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Times()</code> method, allowing you to specify how many times an expectation should be met. This feature enhances the flexibility of your mock database interactions. Meanwhile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maybe()</code> method allows the expectation to be optional. Not calling an optional method will not cause an error while asserting expectations.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<h3 id="improved-test-coverage-">Improved Test Coverage <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/pashagolub/pgxmock?branch=master"><img src="https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pashagolub/pgxmock/badge.svg?branch=master" alt="Coverage Status" /></a></h3>
<p>I‚Äôve extended test coverage, ensuring that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgxmock</code> remains a reliable choice for your testing needs. To make the testing even more comprehensive, I‚Äôve added several new test cases, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TestRowsConn()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TestPanic()</code>. These scenarios cover a wider range of potential use cases. They will help us to eliminate possible bugs in the future.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-up-with-the-times">Keeping Up with the Times</h3>
<p>I‚Äôm staying up-to-date with the latest developments. In this release, I‚Äôve bumped up the Go version to v1.21, ensuring compatibility and leveraging the newest features of the language.</p>

<h3 id="introducing-callmodifier-interface">Introducing CallModifier Interface</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve introduced the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CallModifier</code> interface to expectations, providing greater control and customization when working with mock database calls. All expectations currently support common behavior modifiers, like delay, error, and panic. We can extend the list later with ease.</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-upgrade">Ready to Upgrade?</h2>

<p>I encourage all users to upgrade to <strong>pgxmock v3</strong> to take advantage of these exciting enhancements and improvements. Whether you‚Äôre a long-time user or just getting started with pgxmock, these changes will elevate your database mocking experience to new heights.</p>

<p>To get started with pgxmock v3, simply update your import statement:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="s">"github.com/pashagolub/pgxmock/v3"</span>

<p>and/or run</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>go get <span class="nt">-u</span> github.com/pashagolub/pgxmock/v3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thank you for your continued support and feedback. I look forward to seeing how <strong>pgxmock v3</strong> empowers your PostgreSQL database testing. If you have any questions or need assistance with the upgrade, feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://github.com/pashagolub/pgxmock">GitHub</a>.</p>

My name is <a href="https://postgresql.life/post/pavlo_golub/">Pavlo Golub</a>, and I have been working with PostgreSQL since 2002 when the version was 7.3. As a PostgreSQL developer and consultant, I am excited to share my insights and experiences with you through this personal blog that is not connected with my current or future employer.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my blog, <strong>random pg scribbles</strong>. So, you might be wondering what that title means. The <strong>pg</strong> in the title stands for both <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, the open-source database management system, and <strong>Pavlo Golub</strong> - that‚Äôs me! Basically, this blog is all about my exploration of the PostgreSQL database management system, which is often referred to as ‚ÄòPostgres‚Äô for short. I use the term <strong>scribbles</strong> to convey the idea that the content here is somewhat informal and experimental. I‚Äôm not trying to write highly polished, fully-formed articles - instead, I‚Äôm sharing my thoughts and findings about Postgres in a more free-form, improvisational way.</p>

<p>As for the <strong>random</strong> part, that just means that the content of this blog isn‚Äôt necessarily organized around a specific theme or topic. I might write about different features of Postgres, share tips and tricks for using the software, or just muse on the broader database industry. The idea is that this blog is a space for me to explore my own interests and experiences with Postgres, and to share my thoughts with anyone else who might find them interesting. So if you‚Äôre into databases, or just enjoy reading the musings of a Postgres enthusiast, then stick around - there‚Äôs plenty of random postgres scribbles to come!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to my new blog!]]></summary></entry></feed>
