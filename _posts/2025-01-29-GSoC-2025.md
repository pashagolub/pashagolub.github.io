## A Legacy of PostgreSQL in GSoC

Google Summer of Code 2025 is here, and PostgreSQL is once again proud to participate in this amazing program!
Over the years, many talented contributors have started their PostgreSQL journey through GSoC,
with some becoming long-term members of our community. Their commitment has helped improve PostgreSQL and its
ecosystem, making this program an essential part of our growth and innovation.

Looking ahead, we are excited for new ideas, fresh contributors, and more diversity in projects, mentors, and mentees. PostgreSQL welcomes everyone who wants to contribute and learn, and we encourage
**both new and experienced community members to get involved**.

## Whatâ€™s New for GSoC 2025?

This year, the GSoC team is particularly **looking to support more security and AI/ML projects**. If you know of an **AI/ML or security-focused open-source project**, encourage them to apply for GSoC 2025!

## Who Can Participate?

GSoC is open to **students and newcomers to open-source development**, making it an excellent opportunity for those looking to get involved with PostgreSQL. Whether youâ€™re interested in database internals, extensions, drivers, performance tools, or UI development, thereâ€™s a place for you in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

**Key Dates:**

- **Mentoring organization applications are open now** at [g.co/gsoc](https://g.co/gsoc) and close **February 11, 2025, at 18:00 UTC**.
- If youâ€™re interested in becoming a mentor, now is the time to reach out to us!
- It's time to collect project ideas and update the [GSoC 2025 Ideas page](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2025).
- Read the [GSoC Mentor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) for useful tips.

## Project Ideas and Mentorship

The **most important part of our application as a mentoring organization** is having a **well-defined list of project ideas**. These projects should take approximately:

- **90 hours** (small project),
- **175 hours** (medium project),
- **350 hours** (large project).

We encourage **all PostgreSQL community members** to submit project ideas and volunteer as mentors. Mentorship is essential for growing our community, sharing knowledge, and integrating new contributors into PostgreSQL development.

## Meet Us at FOSDEM

Want to discuss project ideas or mentorship opportunities in person?  
**Letâ€™s talk during [FOSDEM](https://andreas.scherbaum.la/post/2025-01-20_postgresql-at-fosdem-2025/) this week!** PostgreSQL will have a booth and a devroom, so there will be plenty of opportunities to connect.

Also, a few members of the **Google Open Source team** will be at FOSDEM carrying **GSoC pennant flags and blue GSoC beanies**. You can find them:

- **Upper level of Building K, near the large glass doors**
- **Saturday & Sunday from 11:00â€“14:00**  

Stop by and say hi if you're interested in GSoC!

## Apply Now & Spread the Word

As with last year, please consider PostgreSQL to be an **"Umbrella"**
project, and anything that would be regarded as a **"PostgreSQL Family"**
per the [News/Announce policy](https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/news-and-events/)
is likely to be acceptable as a PostgreSQL GSoC project.

In other words, if you're a contributor or developer on WAL-G, barman,
pgBackRest, pgwatch, pgagroal, pgexporter, pgmoneta, pgpool,
pgbouncer, the PostgreSQL website (pgweb), the PgEU/PgUS website code
(pgeu-system), pgAdmin4, DBeaver, HeidiSQL, pldebugger, pspg, the PG
RPMs (pgrpms), the JDBC driver, the ODBC driver, or any of the many
other PG Family projects, please feel free to add a project for
consideration!

We need:

- **Project ideas** that fit the GSoC guidelines.
- **Mentors** to help guide contributors.
- **New contributors** looking to get involved.
- **Community support** to spread awareness.

### Next Steps

- Read the [GSoC Mentor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) and [FAQs](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).
- **Encourage other open-source projects** to apply! If you know of an open-source org that might be a good fit, remind them to check out the [GSoC resources](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources) and use us as a reference.

Letâ€™s make GSoC 2025 another successful year for PostgreSQL and open-source innovation! ðŸš€

Best regards,  
Pavlo Golub,  
on behalf of PostgreSQL GSoC Admins ðŸ’™ðŸ’›
