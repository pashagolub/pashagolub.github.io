I want to share my concerns about [Planet PostgreSQL](https://planet.postgresql.org/) content. Some authors' posts use spam and black SEO techniques, whether consciously or not.

What are the essential properties of such posts? These "posts" are short, contain external links, and without any meaningful supplement.

1. **Planet PostgreSQL is not a microblog aggregator.** I'm sure there is no place for one-sentence postings in the feed. Twitter, Bluesky, and Mastodon are all great places to go. No one will allow me to add my Mastodon RSS feed to the Planet.

2. **Planet PostgreSQL is not a place for gateway pages** - also known as doorway pages. The only purpose of such posts is to rank for particular search queries without offering helpful information. Instead, these micro-posts will redirect the reader to a different page.

3. **Planet PostgreSQL is not a place for a black SEO**. Planet PostgreSQL is a subdomain of a high-ranked [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/). This fact makes the Planet page a perfect place to have as many links to your blog/company site as possible. Posting a lot of meaningless micro-posts will:

- Put and keep the author's name in the "Top posters" section with a link;
- Put and keep the author's company in the "Top Teams" section with a link;
- Put and keep links to micro-posts on the main postgresql.org page.

4. **Planet PostgreSQL is a place for fair play.** As a blog writer, I want to be in the same conditions as everyone else, regardless of the name, status, or previous achievements.

5. **Planet PostgreSQL is a place for diversity and inclusion.** First, I see it as an entry into the world of PostgreSQL â€” the area where one follows the heartbeat of the community. Good-written and interesting stories serve that purpose. Micro-posts with a link in it don't. Second, I see it as a workshop where all authors from competitive companies work together to set a high bar for quality content. Micro-posts are not good and cannot be called content, frankly speaking.
