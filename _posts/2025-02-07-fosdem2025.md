## Introduction

FOSDEM has long been a key event for the PostgreSQL community, and 2025 was no exception. Every year,
PostgreSQL developers, contributors, and users worldwide gather in Brussels for a week packed with talks,
meetings, and discussions. Our community has a strong tradition at FOSDEM, with a dedicated developer room,
a booth, and numerous side events

One of the most recognizable FOSDEM traditions is **FOSDEM Weather** â€” a perfect mix of rain, cold, and clouds
that always greets us in Brussels. Over the years, we even started selling PostgreSQL-branded umbrellas at our booth,
and you could track the weather by watching the sales spike! But this year, for the first time in a while, the weather
was **sunny and perfect** â€” so we joked that the weather was trying to lower our sales. ðŸ˜„

## A Busy Week for PostgreSQL

FOSDEM week is always busy for the PostgreSQL community, with multiple events happening alongside the main conference:

### **P2D2 Conference**

Held earlier in the week, the **Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day (P2D2)** is a major PostgreSQL event that
gathers experts for in-depth discussions. For a detailed experience of the event,
check out [Ants Aasma's blog post](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/my-first-experience-at-p2d2/).

### **PostgreSQL Developer Meeting**

On **Thursday, January 30th**, PostgreSQL core developers and contributors held a private developer
meeting to discuss ongoing projects, significant challenges, and future PostgreSQL development.
More details can be found on the [official event page](https://2025.fosdempgday.org/devmeeting/).

### **FOSDEM PGDay**

On **Friday, January 31st**, we had **FOSDEM PGDay**, a full-day PostgreSQL conference. The schedule
featured talks on a wide range of PostgreSQL topics, from performance tuning to backups and new features.
The complete schedule is available [here](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/fosdem2025/schedule/).

### **PostgreSQL Devroom at FOSDEM**

The **PostgreSQL Devroom** took place on **Sunday, February 2nd**, featuring sessions on database performance,
replication, analytics, AI/ML, and more. This year, we had great discussions about PostgreSQL internals,
best practices, and real-world use cases. You can find the complete session list
[here](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/postgresql/). The talk records will be available shortly.

## Community & Networking

FOSDEM is not just about talksâ€”it's about meeting people, sharing ideas, and strengthening the community.
As usual, there were plenty of social events and informal gatherings.

One of the highlights for me was attending the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) event on Saturday evening**,
where I had the chance to meet new and long-time friends. GSoC continues to be an essential program for PostgreSQL,
and it was great to see the enthusiasm for mentoring and open-source contributions. Right now, PostgreSQL org is
gathering [project ideas and mentors](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2025).
If you want to be a mentor, you still have time until February 10th!

## Contributions & Recognition

This year's central topic of discussion was **contributions**: what counts as a contribution, how we measure it,
and how we recognize non-code contributions. Our community relies on the work of many people beyond just developers:
event organizers, documentation writers, speakers, translators, and advocates all play a massive role in making
PostgreSQL what it is today.

To help highlight and recognize these contributions, we put a lot of effort into building our new website:
**[postgres-contrib.org](https://postgres-contrib.org/)**. This platform helps track contributions and
provides a way to nominate and recognize those who support the community.

## Closing Thoughts

The **spirit of the PostgreSQL community** is what makes FOSDEM so special every year. I want to extend my
**huge thanks** to all the volunteers, organizers, and contributors who made this event possible.

Special thanks to:

- The [Call for Papers team](https://2025.fosdempgday.org/callforpapers/) (which I was part of) for reviewing and selecting the talks.
- All **speakers** who shared their knowledge.
- The **attendees** who made the devroom lively and interactive.

A special shoutout to **volunteers**, both scheduled and spontaneous. While we had a volunteer schedule
for the booth, many community members stepped up to help when needed. For example, **Bruce Momjian**
spent hours assisting visitors at the booth, helping find PostgreSQL T-shirts and hoodies in the correct sizes.
And **Ants Aasma** helped a team of bouncers (well, pg bouncers, if you know what I mean ;) ).
Many others did the same, proving once again that our community is built on **collaboration and generosity**.

We had a fantastic time at FOSDEM 2025, and I can't wait to do it all again next year!

Until then, keep contributing and keep the PostgreSQL spirit alive! ðŸš€
