On the 5th of February 2023, I had the privilege of giving a talk <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the PostgreSQL devroom during FOSDEM 2023</a> titled "When it all GOes right." My talk focused on the process of creating programs in the Go language using a PostgreSQL database. It was an incredible opportunity to share my insights and experiences with fellow open-source enthusiasts from around the world, and to discuss the latest trends and developments in this rapidly evolving field. In this blog post, I'll provide the key takeaways and links to the sources to explore some of the most exciting innovations in Go and PostgreSQL programming. Slides in PDF format are available on the <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/fosdem2023/schedule/session/4096-when-it-all-goes-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOSDEM PgDay 2023 event page</a>.
