We expect GSoC contributors to actively participate in the Community Bonding period from May 8th to June 1st.
This period's goal is to prepare contributors to begin their project work effectively on June 2nd.
So please help them accommodate.

It was an insane start to the year! The GSoC program had the highest number of proposals ever,
as well as the highest number of spam and AI-generated applications. Due to the high volume
of new organizations and applications for the first time, on my memory, the PostgreSQL organization
got only seven project slots out of 9!

This year, there were 213 total applications to PostgreSQL org only (sic!), the highest number we've
had in 21 years of #GSoC! I really appreciate the hard work of our mentors, especially those whose
projects weren't accepted this year. Also, I am glad and proud at the same time because several
of this year's mentors are GSoC alumni of previous years! Kudos to everyone and all of us!

At the same time, I'm thankful to all the applicants who have spent their precious time! Please remember
that despite not being part of the GSoC program this year, you are more than welcome in the PostgreSQL
community! As a community, we will do our best to help you become a part of it.
